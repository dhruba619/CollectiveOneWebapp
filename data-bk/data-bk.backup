This is not the case in my proposal. However, the model I propose is informative about how to conceptualise the statistical inference problem. Indeed, I think that it is the first step, and it is the best way to present the decision mechanism to a general audience.

6	2017-01-04 20:50:22.511	I am the founder of www.autoebid.com a consumer champion helping consumers to save time and money and stop getting ripped off. The service is a 1st to market reverse auction marketplace that has taken over £230m in online orders. Having recently my business, I now want to do start my next venture and do something meaningful, don’t we all?\r\n\r\nMy profile is at https://uk.linkedin.com/in/amin-saleem-338b94\r\nI am looking to create a new dynamic platform that will be focused on helping businesses and individuals to work more efficiently, save time and money, enable ethically focused small business to compete with some of the large corporate organisations who are creating many problems facing society.\r\n\r\nMuch of the service will be a fermium service (fee for users) with revenues derived from collective purchasing and procurement solutions. Individuals and organizations are able to negotiate better terms with vendors, create economies of scale and even generate additional income by benefiting from the buying power of millions.\r\n\r\nGovernments, charities businesses and the general public are all under tremendous pressure to reduce their costs and become more efficient, that where we can step in. Our marketplace enables users to buy the right product from the right supplier at the best possible price.\r\n\r\nI am considering setting up my new organization under a co-operative type business model offering all employees a 10% share in the business (including all contractors) in addition to 10% going to customers. As https://www.bcorporation.net provide a good structure for an ethical transparent business, I was considering going with them.\r\n\r\nI think it’s important to be a for profit organization, however, we will be a “People before Profit” company. The solutions aim is to help drive positive change by empowering individuals and business to work and consume better. The organization will carry the same responsibilities as a, not for profit company but will have the flexibility to invest some of those profits into other projects that support our aims as well as attracting the best talent around the world.\r\n\r\nI am at the beginning stage of this exciting project and looking to create a team to get the project off the ground. The project is going to be funded by myself initially, I still need to define the project, recruit a team,  build and launch a beta version of the solution.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in getting involved with the project get in contact, via slack - [https://smartdealmaker.slack.com](https://smartdealmaker.slack.com)\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n	t	Smartdealmaker-project	100	17

1	2016-09-04 12:55:13.786	This is a general tag that is useful to group the activity related to the conceptual analysis of CoProjects	1	1	71
2	2016-09-05 16:03:11.799	He makes a lot of english typos	1	1	105
3	2016-09-05 16:03:27.427	He dont have time now	1	1	105
4	2016-09-10 11:31:57.543	The idea is that goals are hierarchical, so that any goal can be decomposed in any number of subgoals an indefinite number of times.	1	1	146
5	2016-09-10 11:32:31.597	The set of goals should tend to become the "technical specification' of the project.	1	1	146
6	2016-09-10 11:33:38.624	The name "milestones" suggests that they are long term and have similar detail level among them	1	1	146
7	2016-09-10 11:33:57.028	The name goals is weird	0	1	146
8	2016-10-06 16:44:28.198	Its very uncomfortable to not having the option of opening in a new tab. This is really needed	0	1	182
9	2016-10-06 16:45:41.378	Actually ANCHORS have other associated problems. They should be changed to Buttons.	1	7	182
10	2016-10-06 16:47:38.102	Search engines bots wont be able to understand the page structure if we dont change this divs for anchors or buttons	0	4	182
11	2016-10-13 14:33:14.543	The current prototype should be enough to be used to further develop both the CollectiveOne concept and the web application, as long as 1) it is used in combination of other tools, like Slack and GitHub, 2) there is good will in those getting involved, and 3) the number of people involved is not excessive. 	0	1	232
12	2016-10-14 10:24:00.244	This step is aligned with the concepts of openness and soft ownership promoted by CollectiveOne	0	1	232
14	2016-10-14 10:41:25.233	Allowing others (not the in-kind contributors) to absorb the risk of project failure out of the in-kind contributors could make attracting in-kind contributors easier. 	0	1	233
15	2016-10-14 10:47:49.775	Having the *option* of contributing with money instead of in-kind contributors does not means forbidding in-kind contributions in exchange of participation points. Perhaps both can coexist. 	0	1	233
16	2016-10-14 18:52:56.472	Perhaps the kickstarter campaign is not incompatible with promoting CollectiveOne in Reddit and slack channels. With the kickstarter campaign people interested can opt between putting money or directly contributing, and contributors can decide if getting paid in money or in participation points. 	0	1	233
17	2016-10-14 18:56:24.27	Preparing a successful kickstarter campaign requires a lot of effort and probably some investment (video, logo... ).	1	1	233
18	2016-10-14 19:09:24.682	Getting more people inside before key open points have been solved (e.g. the business model) might complicate things too much 	1	1	232
13	2016-10-14 10:34:02.266	Paying for contributions is not fully inline with the method proposed by CollectiveOne: that retributing contributors with participation points is enough. 	1	1	233
19	2016-10-18 08:37:02.348	The fastest the CollectiveOne method is tested, the sooner we will know if it makes sense, and we will have hints on how to improve it.	0	1	232
20	2016-10-18 08:45:09.472	Previous experiences of other collaborative open projects platforms like Bettermeans, Assembly and, now, Collaborizm and Colony, suggest that the standard company approach (founder-investor-workers) may not be the most adequate for this kind of projects. Once we have investors on-board, they will probably constrain the path ahead by pushing for a less-open path. 	1	1	233
21	2016-10-19 13:57:56.728	The ‘kickstarter’ approach does require lots of prep time. But we must assess how that time compares with the competing alternatives. Funding the project directly (i.e. hiring someone with our money to do the job) probably requires the same amount of time, but locks out valuable feedback . Opening the platform to contributions from anyone requires us to potentially vote on MANY proposals/decisions from people who lack sufficient information to propose meaningful contributions.  I would imagine having to vote down hundreds of proposals before someone actually gets a concrete meaningful contribution assigned. See my arguments to the related decision https://collectiveone.herokuapp.com/views/DecisionPage.action?decisionId=232	0	3	233
22	2016-10-19 14:04:13.999	I think that opening the project completely (prototype and concept) implies risks and potentially lots of wasted time. Risks come from allowing the project to diverge too quickly from what we *would* want it to be (the issue here is that there is not enough structure for our arguments and model to show full potential).  Wasted time is a concern, to the extent that the current state of the project is insufficient to allow concrete meaningful contributions. We would spend lots of time explaining ourselves.  	1	3	232
23	2016-10-19 14:10:03.678	I think we could try to open up the model (at the same time that we launch a kickstarter campaign), but without inviting point contributions (and without opening the prototype). This could be done along the lines of what @pepospina is already doing here: https://medium.com/@pepoospina/labor-only-tokens-for-decentralized-autonomous-companies-c2e62a653a41#.seecbrf3q \n\nThe reason for doing this instead of what the decision item suggests, is that we can be more selective  in the way we allocate our time and resources (e.g. ignore people who just ask millions of questions). See my other comment below about fears of 'uncontrolled' demands for our time.	1	3	232
24	2016-10-19 14:12:45.913	Milestones imply a fixed time horizon. In some projects there will be goals (those high up in the hierarchy) that are likely never reached – and that's probably fine	1	3	146
25	2016-10-19 21:18:04.372	Graph databases are awesome	0	5	267
26	2016-10-20 14:48:14.195	SQL table seems sufficient for a while and for a proof of concept. When the database grows and more data is stored, migrating to a NoSQL graph database could be considered	1	1	267
27	2016-10-20 14:50:57.231	The possibility can remain open. Whenever someone wants to devote time to recreate the current db with neoj4. a contribution can be created for this	0	1	267
28	2016-10-21 18:41:38.597	Dangerous terrain here	1	1	278
29	2016-10-21 18:42:16.131	It could help as a red button to protect CollectiveOne from abuses.	0	1	278
30	2016-10-23 21:39:34.492	Sound is too amateurish and it could scare people out more that what it actually invite in. (by Esteban) 	1	1	280
31	2016-10-25 16:01:37.66	It includes more information than what the slides do.	0	1	292
33	2016-11-24 12:12:32.63	The team at Sensorica has been working on open projects for a few years now (seems from 2011 or so). I would like to know their overall impression on the method proposed by CollectiveOne.	0	1	418
34	2016-11-24 12:15:05.87	Although their platform seems quite oriented to the products developed at their lab, and there seems to be significant differences within the two approaches, we could explore the option of merging efforts instead of duplicating them.	0	1	418
35	2016-11-25 01:15:20.473	Reaching out to them seems very much in the spirit of open collaboration. Both projects should benefit, and you never know what a conversation might spark even if it may be only at some point in the future.	0	9	418
36	2016-11-30 11:10:13.351	Our chances might be low due to our low traction (number of users and projects), but there might be a chance anyway.	0	1	476
37	2016-11-30 11:11:11.679	If selected, we could nevertheless review the conditions of the support received and decide if accepting it or not.	0	1	476
38	2016-11-30 11:11:55.328	If selected, the visibility of CollectiveOne would boost attracting new contributors and projects.	0	1	476

44	2016-12-14 20:51:37.22	I think this only (or at least _mainly_) makes sense if we can place someone full time there for the three months of the fellowship. That's a big cost for anyone	1	3	603

1	This comment was added after completing the contribution	2016-09-27 17:40:21.011	0	63	1	\N
2	and so this reply to the comment. Would it work?	2016-09-27 17:40:43.698	0	63	1	1
3	yes!	2016-09-27 17:40:57.131	0	63	1	2
4	A dummy version of the welcome page is already there but should be improved	2016-09-28 15:59:26.363	0	59	1	\N
5	After making an update of goals, now I think that perhaps we should try to stick with the single goal per contribution approach. Since goal have parent goals, it can be assumed that a contribution applies to its goal, and also to all its parents. Users can then discuss and agree on the goals structure, rather than on the assigning multiple goals to one contribution 	2016-10-03 14:51:02.765	0	40	1	\N
6	Perhaps we should keep this contribution limited to a first draft that clearly conveys the message and shows the key features of the application and use other contributions to improve it, and eventually convert it into a welcome video	2016-10-06 17:16:33.338	0	68	1	\N
8	Another option is to be able to link arguments applying these relation after they have been created. This seems more complex though	2016-10-24 15:33:51.589	0	89	1	\N
9	I can share the edition file of the older version to be used as a starting point. It already includes a lot of cuts and extensions. The narration file is in https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B6HEie5ZN03bMnFyaWtEcHYxMzQ	2016-11-11 10:28:00.243	0	106	1	\N
11	This is no longer an issue after migrating to spring boot	2016-11-20 17:51:25.966	0	100	1	\N
12	The basic test infrastructure should include an example of creating users in the database using a test-only method, and perform other operations on the database using the formal application services. The entire operations in the database shall be valid within the test, but rolled back when it finishes.	2016-11-21 12:30:34.175	0	116	\N	\N
13	This is not mandatory now since there is a form in at collectiveone.org to provide the email and ask for an invitation	2016-11-26 12:56:29.163	0	103	1	\N
14	First Google result seems promising : http://www.codingdrama.com/bootstrap-markdown/	2016-11-29 08:39:37.439	0	125	1	\N
15	This implies to configure, replace or extend the current autocomplete functionality to show all the possible suggestions when the text-box is empty. Currently, suggestions are shown only after the first letter is typed	2016-11-29 10:20:29.055	0	128	1	\N
16	The contributions created and the comments on the slack are considered enough. Go on and Bid!	2016-11-29 10:24:50.666	0	130	1	\N
17	I think this is called tooltips. We could directly use bootstrap plugin http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_tooltip.asp	2016-11-29 10:26:12.575	0	127	1	\N
19	Not quite sure how the plugin chooses the options in the dropdown menu. But I have the impression that it is choosing goals at the lowest level (the leaves in the goal tree). Maybe we could try to have these displayed with the name of the parent goal? E.g. frontend (webapp)\nMight require changing the plugin though...	2016-11-30 08:30:46.77	0	128	3	15

18	This is a short term solution to the tree structure proposed in  http://www.collectiveone.org/views/cbtionPageR/130 \n	2016-11-30 08:26:45.351	1	133	3	\N
22	The problem is that the link should point to the contributions of one project in particular. Should it point to the contributions of CollectiveOne only?	2016-11-30 18:14:44.641	0	133	1	18
23	This is related to the http session. Projects at show only are updated at session start. Project creation is for the moment very sporadic, this should be reviewed and fixed but perhaps is not a priority.	2016-12-02 09:44:19.894	0	144	1	\N
7	This is a significant (and quite fundamental) contribution by @estenanortizospina, however I suggest we consider it closed once it has been tested to include non-homogeneous pps distributions, and when a time bound mechanism, similar to the one already in place, has been specified and tested in R.	2016-10-07 16:13:33.935	1	55	1	\N
25	Consider how this is different from the use case where history is desired but the project should be "retired".	2016-12-02 20:20:22.192	0	147	9	\N
26	This comment will prove it works... hopefully	2016-12-04 18:00:30.05	0	151	1	\N
27	yes!	2016-12-04 18:00:49.759	0	151	1	26
28	I think that a general contribution can be ok for this stage of the contacts, while specific ones would be better in case one of the contacts requires specific attention	2016-12-12 16:00:32.163	0	161	1	\N
29	Notice that decision duration represents the _maximum possible duration_. \n\nIn practice, the actual duration is lower as it is dynamically derived using the decision mechanism based on some statistical analyses	2016-12-13 09:00:09.823	0	88	1	\N
30	I have recreated this contribution item [here](http://www.collectiveone.org/views/cbtionPageR/169) to allow Esteban to re bid on it.	2016-12-15 16:16:41.312	0	55	1	\N
24	I agree that for the new algorithm to be a real alternative, we need to allow for a non-homogeneous distribution of pps. Having said that, the proposal that I have is informative about how to conceptualise the statistical inference problem. Indeed, I think that it is the first step, and it is the best way to present the decision mechanism to a general audience. I believe this adds value to the project even if it is not implemented.\n\nBased on the above, I think that I am willing to revise the number of pps that I requested. I believe that the model and algorithm with homogeneous distribution of pps should be worth 75 points.	2016-12-02 14:47:56.977	1	55	3	7
31	For background see [this rejected contribution](http://www.collectiveone.org/views/cbtionPageR/55)	2016-12-15 20:30:01.702	0	169	3	\N
32	Ok, I will create a project, would be good to have a link from here to start...	2017-01-04 12:17:06.737	0	176	17	\N
33	Great! Here is the [link](http://www.collectiveone.org/views/projectNewPageR). You should tell me the name of the project you are interested in creating to pre-authorize it.	2017-01-04 12:27:24.262	0	176	1	32
35	Its zero because the "suggested bid" field for a new contribution was added after this contribution was created. All contributions created before have zero as suggested bid.	2017-01-04 12:51:46.177	0	165	1	34
34	Sure, do I provide feedback in this space ? why is the suggested bid 0?\n\nRegards	2017-01-04 12:29:09.962	1	165	17	\N
51	Can I bid now?	2017-02-01 20:12:41.159	0	202	20	\N
52	Yes sure!	2017-02-01 20:12:53.351	0	202	22	51
36	Take into account, also, that I have prepared a business model proposal trying to converge. The document can be found **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nqxnsaSL3dlErPfeqPyCvCbJ_sqRmQdW2C0ccefMU-I/edit)**.\n\nTo provide the feedback, the best way would be though comments or suggestions in the google doc. I will give you edition rights.	2017-01-04 13:41:12.723	1	165	1	34
38	It's only 62 euro. There is not a fixed exchange rate for this kind of contributions. For previous ones we used 4 euros -> 1 pp\n\nSuggested bid is zero because the contribution was created before the "suggested bid" feature existed. There is no a fixed exchange rate 	2017-01-05 09:36:34.966	0	157	1	37
39	We are aware that the prototype is very basic, and there is plenty of improvements that need to be done. Esteban (@eortizospina) already made a **[first proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epKcfoc_UtzeKzA1OJmArgYenNMAqnzVDxegqygXXjk/edit?usp=sharing)** of what he feels to be the most important improvement: a navigation pane on the left that decompose projects into goals and allow the user to promptly filter the results per goal. There are other improvements which are mandatory as personalized notifications, to help people follow the activity. \n\nIn addition, there are already some individualized contributions for the webapp development. You can see them under the **[+webapp goal](http://www.collectiveone.org/views/goalPageR?projectName=CollectiveOne&goalTag=webapp)**\n\nThis contribution could be focused in identifying other key improvements, and prioritizing them. Your feedback can be either a document or a comment on the **[#webapp](https://collectiveone.slack.com/messages/webapp/details/)** Slack channel	2017-01-05 09:53:37.537	0	171	1	\N
37	Looks like it's 840 Euro ?  Why is there not a suggested Bid on something so straightforward?	2017-01-05 09:18:55.558	1	157	17	\N
40	I have seen now that the link has expired. This event was held on December 8th. The contribution is still open to leave room for people interested in funding it to do it. I am willing to fund it at a 4 euros per pp.	2017-01-05 10:42:05.945	1	157	1	37
41	There is already possible to disable a project, effectively hiding all its information. The script would be useful mostly to clean test projects 	2017-01-06 20:07:57.504	0	147	1	25
42	This is relatively complex. Perhaps it would be better to create a goal and start by designing the solution 	2017-01-07 15:45:34.564	0	89	1	\N
43	I have created also a [user manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x1Vl08jHonYukIvV80iRqouqjwolhsFCWWcTPbSd9js/edit), so this contribution can be seen as a video version of the user manual.	2017-01-09 15:58:36.121	1	167	1	\N
44	Supersede by events. 	2017-01-09 16:03:39.706	0	114	1	\N
45	If this goes forward, it should be defined as a goal	2017-01-09 16:07:04.867	0	76	1	\N
53	The project is actually online and called "Sandbox"	2017-02-02 17:08:47.214	0	185	1	\N
54	There is a lot of work to be done here. I will make significant updates to the algorithm benchmark [R code](https://github.com/CollectiveOne/CollectiveOne-R).	2017-02-04 19:43:51.442	0	210	1	\N
55	This contribution is in preparation to an escenario in which project creation becomes much more common.	2017-02-05 18:00:06.77	0	212	1	\N
56	This sounds like the perfect start. We will be engaging more participants throughout the process.	2017-02-07 18:36:46.496	1	216	9	\N
