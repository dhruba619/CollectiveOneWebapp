				<h1>Welcome to CollectiveOne (Beta)</h1>
				<p>CollectiveOne is a method (and a platform) to develop open, 
				decentralized and collaborative projects: projects to which anyone can, 
				potentially, contribute, and which are collectively owned and self-governed 
				by their contributors.</p>

					<h2>Principles</h2>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="principle col-md-4">
							<h3>Open collaboration</h3>
							Like open-source projects, entry barriers are kept low to allow anyone to contribute to a project in similar conditions as those of previous contributors.
						</div>
						<div class="principle col-md-4">
							<h3>Contribution record and value</h3>
							Individual contributions are recognized and valued relative to each other, using a project specific token called <i>participation points</i>.
						</div>
						<div class="principle col-md-4">
							<h3>Liquid ownership</h3>
							The ownership of each project is linked to contributions, and, therefore, to participation points. The more you contribute, the more you own.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="principle col-md-6">
							<h3>Efficient decentralized decision-making</h3>
							Decisions are taken openly, letting any contributor to take/influence any decision. At the same time, it is not required, nor promoted, that all contributors influence all decisions, and voting weights can be different among contributors.
						</div>
						<div class="principle col-md-6">
							<h3>Transparency and open data</h3>
							Projects data and communication channels are as open as possible, a necessary condition to balance the opportunity to participate. Moreover, transparency in CollectiveOne could reach <i>hardcore</i> levels, since a detailed record of all the contributions and decisions within a project may also become publicly available.
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br />
				<h2>Roadmap</h2>
					CollectiveOne wants to become, itself, a decentralized project, and be
					developed openly with contributions from new participants. 
					The development pace of CollectiveOne will depend on the amount of contributors. 
					It wants to be a product-driven project. The more contributors, the faster it should go.
